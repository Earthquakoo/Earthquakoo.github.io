Under $K$-shot setting, multiple episodes from both sets. Each episode consists of a support set $$\mathcal{S}$$ and query sample $$\mathcal{Q}$$.

$$ \mathcal{S}={(x_s^k, m_s^k)}_{k=1}^K $$

where $$(x_s^k, m_s^k)$$ is $$k-th$$ support image and its corresponding segmentation mask pair.

and eof a query sample

$$ \mathcal{S}={(x_s^k, m_s^k)}_{k=1}^K $$
